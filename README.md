## Overview

DeathLog tracks your deaths in all worlds and servers. It does this completely client-side and records important metadata like coordinates, dimension and even your entire inventory. Since version 0.2.0 onward however, DeathLog can also operate server-side and track all deaths of all players on that server, with native functionality for restoring a death snapshot. DeathLog can be used on both sides without being required on the other, however managing the server's database is significantly easier with a DeathLog-enabled client.
